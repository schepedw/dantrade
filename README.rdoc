== DanTrade

A brief foray into front end development.

===Tools
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* fontAwesome
* sass

===API
/compare.json?ticker=xxxx

This api is used by the front end. aJax -> api ->dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/json

Having ajax call this api rather than markitondemand allows me to get around markitondemand not implementing [cors][http://enable-cors.org/]
